# Flight Price Prediction ML Project

## Overview
This project is focused on predicting flight prices using machine learning techniques. The analysis and model training are documented in the Jupyter notebook `Rotem_Mihailovitch_Oren_Drori_Final_Project_python102.ipynb`.

## Dependencies
To run the notebook, you will need to install the following dependencies:
- [numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/)
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/contents.html)
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/documentation.html)
- [sklearn.preprocessing](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html)
- [sklearn.cluster](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html)
- [sklearn.model_selection](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html)
- [sklearn.ensemble](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html)
- [sklearn.metrics](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html)
- [sklearn.tree](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html)
- [matplotlib (version)](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing.html)

## How It Works
The notebook contains several functions and code blocks that:
- Load and preprocess the data
- Explore the data through visualizations
- Build and train machine learning models
- Evaluate the models and fine-tune them for better performance
  

## Insights
The notebook provides insights into the factors that affect flight prices and how different models perform in predicting them.

## Usage
To use this project, clone the repository, install the dependencies, and run the Jupyter notebook.
